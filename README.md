# 2d-fighting-game
## My OCR GCE A Computer Science Project
My aim with this project is to ease inexperienced fighting game players into the genre, with a game that is accessible to those audiences, but also rewards execution to experience players the same way a normal fighting game would.

This is achieved in this project by offering weaker "shortcut" inputs that allow for special moves to be inputted with one button and a direction, similarly to modern control schemes in recent fighting games, but the game also allows full motion inputs to be used, rewarding the player's execution with more damage. 

These simpler inputs will be avaliable to all players, so players aren't split between two different control schemes, and the shortcut inputs will have a use cooldown so that they cannot be used repeatedly. Thus, all players are encouraged to incorporate both the full motion and shortcut inputs into their gameplay.

The game is open source, so feel free to fork this repository and make your own characters based on the template!

## Guidance on Coursework
I cannot show you my coursework document, because of the risk I would take that some bad actors would plagarise the work as a form of malpractice and I could be penalised for it, especially if I uploaded it to GitHub. Therefore, while the program is indeed my final project, the coursework is what you are marked on.
